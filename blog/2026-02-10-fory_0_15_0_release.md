## Go Serialization: First Release

Apache Fory 0.15.0 is the first release with official Go serialization support.
The Go implementation delivers high-performance serialization with cross-language
compatibility and production-focused configuration options.

**Key capabilities:**

- Cross-language mode with Java, Python, `cpp`, Rust, and JavaScript (`fory.WithXlang(true)`)
- Reflection-based serialization by default, plus optional experimental AOT code generation for hot paths
- Reference tracking for shared/circular object graphs (`fory.WithTrackRef(true)` + `fory:"ref"` tags)
- Compatible mode for schema evolution (`fory.WithCompatible(true)`) supporting add/remove/reorder field changes
- Thread-safe wrapper (`github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/threadsafe`) for concurrent workloads

### Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory"
)

type User struct {
    ID   int64
    Name string
}

func main() {
    f := fory.New(
        fory.WithXlang(true),
        fory.WithCompatible(true),
    )
    _ = f.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1)

    data, _ := f.Serialize(&User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"})
    var out User
    _ = f.Deserialize(data, &out)
}
```

Below are timing results (ns/op; lower is better) comparing Fory with Protobuf and Msgpack across representative data structures.

## Fory Schema IDL and Compiler: First Release

Apache Fory 0.15.0 also introduces the first release of the Fory schema IDL and
compiler toolchain. You can define schemas once and generate native types and
registration code across languages.

**Key capabilities:**

- Schema-first development with `enum`, `message`, and `union`
- Fory-native field semantics: `optional` (nullability), `ref` (shared/circular references), `list`, and `map`
- Multi-language code generation for Java, Python, Go, Rust, and `cpp`
- Protobuf (`.proto`) and FlatBuffers (`.fbs`) frontend support, translated into Fory IR/codegen
- Idiomatic generated APIs with `to/from bytes` helpers

### Quick Start

```bash
pip install fory-compiler
foryc example.fdl --lang java,python,go,rust,cpp --output ./generated
```

```protobuf
package example;

message Person [id=101] {
    string name = 1;
    optional string email = 2;
}
```

### Generated Code Example

`foryc` generates idiomatic native types plus registration/byte helpers. For the
schema above, generated code looks like:

```go
// Go (excerpt)
type Person struct {
    Name  string                    `fory:"id=1"`
    Email optional.Optional[string] `fory:"id=2"`
}

func (m *Person) ToBytes() ([]byte, error)      { ... }
func (m *Person) FromBytes(data []byte) error   { ... }
func RegisterTypes(f *fory.Fory) error {
    return f.RegisterStruct(Person{}, 101)
}
```

```java
// Java (excerpt)
public class Person {
    @ForyField(id = 1)
    private String name;

    @ForyField(id = 2, nullable = true)
    private String email;

    public byte[] toBytes() { ... }
    public static Person fromBytes(byte[] bytes) { ... }
}
```

```python
# Python (excerpt)
@pyfory.dataclass
class Person:
    name: str = pyfory.field(id=1, default="")
    email: Optional[str] = pyfory.field(id=2, default=None)

    def to_bytes(self) -> bytes: ...
    @classmethod
    def from_bytes(cls, data: bytes) -> "Person": ...
```
