---

The Apache Fory team is pleased to announce the 0.14.0 release. This is a major release that includes [85 PR](https://github.com/apache/fory/compare/v0.13.2...v0.14.0) from 11 distinct contributors. See the [Install](https://fory.apache.org/docs/start/install) Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

## Highlights

- **Official C++ Support**: First release of Apache Fory C++ with high-performance object graph serialization, cross-language interoperability, and schema evolution
- **Row Format & Type System**: New row-oriented format type system across Java, Python, and C++, enabling row-columnar conversions and removing Arrow dependencies
- **Performance Enhancements**: Significant optimizations across all languages, including thread-local context in Rust and fast flat-int maps for C++ type dispatch
- **Ecosystem Updates**: Added support for JDK 25 (Java), Go 1.23, and Bazel 8. Python officially marked as stable with improved build parallelism
- **Advanced Java Features**: GraalVM Native Image support via `ForyFeature` and optimized serializers for blocking queues and final fields
- **ObjectStreamSerializer Refactoring**: Refactored `ObjectStreamSerializer` with meta-shared compatible mode for reduced space cost and improved performance on JDK customized serialization APIs

## C++: First Release Highlights

This is the first Apache Fory C++ release, delivering a complete, high-performance serialization framework for modern C++17. If you build C++ applications requiring fast serialization, cross-language communication, or schema evolution, Fory C++ provides type-safe, compile-time serialization with minimal overhead.

**Key capabilities:**

- Macro-based struct registration via `FORY_STRUCT` for compile-time type safety
- Cross-language serialization with Java, Python, Go, Rust, and JavaScript
- Forward/backward compatible schema evolution (Compatible mode)
- Reference tracking for shared objects and circular references
- Thread-safe and single-threaded (fastest) variants
- Comprehensive type support: primitives, `std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::optional`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`, `std::variant`, and temporal types
- Zero-copy Row format for analytics workloads with random field access
- CMake (FetchContent) and Bazel build system support

### Quick Start

```cpp
#include "fory/serialization/fory.h"

using namespace fory::serialization;

struct Person {
  std::string name;
  int32_t age;
  std::vector<std::string> hobbies;
  FORY_STRUCT(Person, name, age, hobbies);
};

int main() {
  auto fory = Fory::builder()
      .xlang(true)       // Enable cross-language mode
      .track_ref(false)  // Disable ref tracking for simple types
      .build();
  fory.register_struct<Person>(1);

  Person person{"Alice", 30, {"reading", "coding"}};
  auto bytes = fory.serialize(person).value();
  Person decoded = fory.deserialize<Person>(bytes).value();
  // person == decoded
  return 0;
}
```

### C++ Benchmarks

Below are timing results (nanoseconds; lower is better) comparing Fory with Protobuf across different data structures.

| Datatype     | Operation   | Fory (ns) | Protobuf (ns) | Faster      |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| MediaContent | Serialize   | 414       | 2,046         | Fory (4.9x) |
| MediaContent | Deserialize | 1,361     | 2,890         | Fory (2.1x) |
| Sample       | Serialize   | 210       | 307           | Fory (1.5x) |
| Sample       | Deserialize | 1,061     | 1,500         | Fory (1.4x) |
| Struct       | Serialize   | 51        | 181           | Fory (3.5x) |
| Struct       | Deserialize | 136       | 170           | Fory (1.3x) |

Note: Results depend on hardware and implementation versions. See the C++ benchmark guide for how to run benchmarks yourself: https://github.com/apache/fory/tree/main/benchmarks/cpp_benchmark
