---

The Apache Fory team is pleased to announce the 0.13.0 release. This is a major release that includes [217 PR](https://github.com/apache/fory/compare/v0.12.3...v0.13.0) from 19 distinct contributors. See the [Install](https://fury.apache.org/docs/docs/start/install) Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

## Highlights

- Dynamic Trait Object Serialization for Rust
- Shared/Circular ownership serialization for Rust
- Schema Forward/Backward compatibilify for Rust
- Drop-in Replacement for Python pickle: support local function/classes/`__reduce__`/`__getstate__` serialization
- Schema Forward/Backward compatibilify for Python dataclass
- Support codegen for xlang mode in java
- Primitive array compression using SIMD
- Compact Row Codec for Row Format
- Schema Forward/Backward compatibilify for Go
- Ahead-of-time codegen for golang struct serialization

## Rust: First Release Highlights

This is the first Apache Fory Rust release, delivering a complete, high‑performance serialization stack. If you build Rust services or libraries, you can now use Fory natively with strong typing, performance, and schema evolution.

- Derive-based object graph serialization via `#[derive(ForyObject)]`
- Polymorphism for trait objects: `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, `Arc<dyn Trait>`, plus `dyn Any`
- Shared and circular reference tracking: `Rc`/`Arc` and `RcWeak`/`ArcWeak`
- Forward/backward compatible schema evolution (Compatible mode)
- Zero-copy Row format via `#[derive(ForyRow)]` with selective field access
- Thread-safe and multi-thread capable serialization (context pool)
- Broad collection support (e.g., `VecDeque`, `LinkedList`, `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet`, `BinaryHeap`)

### Quick start (minimal example):

```rust
use fory::{Fory, Error};
use fory::ForyObject;

#[derive(ForyObject, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct User {
	name: String,
	age: i32,
	email: String,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
	let mut fory = Fory::default();
	fory.register::<User>(1)?;

	let user = User { name: "Alice".into(), age: 30, email: "alice@example.com".into() };
	let bytes = fory.serialize(&user)?;
	let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
	assert_eq!(user, decoded);
	Ok(())
}
```

## Python: Drop‑in Replacement for pickle

`pyfory` now acts as a high‑performance drop‑in replacement for `pickle`/`cloudpickle`, while keeping the same simple API and adding security and performance features.

- Serialize any Python object in Python‑native mode (`xlang=False`): global/local functions, lambdas, global/local classes, instance/class/static methods
- Honors Python hooks: `__getstate__`, `__setstate__`, `__reduce__`, `__reduce_ex__`
- Reference tracking for shared/circular graphs with `ref=True`
- Pickle protocol 5 out‑of‑band buffers for zero‑copy via `pickle.PickleBuffer` (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
- Security: `strict=True` for registration‑based safety and `DeserializationPolicy` for fine‑grained control
- Threading: `ThreadSafeFory` for safe multi‑thread use
- Familiar API: `dumps/loads` are aliases of `serialize/deserialize`

Quick start:

```python
import pyfory

# Drop-in replacement for pickle/cloudpickle
fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=True, strict=False)

def make_multiplier(k):
	def mul(x):
		return k * x
	return mul

binary = fory.dumps(make_multiplier(10))
assert fory.loads(binary)(3) == 30
```
