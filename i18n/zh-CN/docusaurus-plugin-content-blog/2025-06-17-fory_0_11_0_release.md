## Highlights

* Add Dart Serialization support
* Chunk-based map serialization for Java/Python with performance optimizations and XLang support
* Cross-language homogeneous collection serialization between Java/Python
* Refactor XLang type system and serialization for fory go
* Performance improvements in Python (dict/tuple/list serialization, C-API optimization)
* Row format evolution with support for Optional, Records, nested beans, and interface synthesis
* Unify Java and XLang object serialization with cross-language compatibility for enums, time, arrays, and more
* Renamed Apache Fury to Apache Fory

## Breaking Changes

* Renamed Apache Fury to Apache Fory, this transition impacts all project components including code repositories, maven groupId, jar names, package names, documentation, and communication channels and the source release name (and location), see [Rename Announcement]( https://fory.apache.org/blog/fury_renamed_to_fory) for more details.
