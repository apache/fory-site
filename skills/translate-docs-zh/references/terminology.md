# Translation Terminology (zh-CN)

This file defines preferred Chinese terminology for Apache Fory documentation translation.
Use these terms consistently across all translated docs.

## Core Rules

1. Prefer stable technical terms used in Chinese engineering docs.
2. Keep identifiers/protocol fields/type names in English when they are code symbols.
3. Do not translate terms in code blocks unless they are comments intended for readers.
4. If a term is ambiguous, choose the wording that matches protocol semantics, not product marketing wording.

## Canonical Terms

| English Term | Preferred Chinese | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wire format | 编码格式 | Do not use `线协议` in this repo context. |
| serialization format | 序列化格式 | Use for data layout/encoding docs. |
| protocol | 协议 | Use only when discussing protocol semantics. |
| transport | 传输 | Use only for network transport context; do not replace encoding semantics with this term. |
| schema evolution | Schema 演进 | Keep `Schema` as-is in mixed technical headings when already used by repo style. |
| compatible mode | 兼容模式 | |
| type meta | 类型元信息 | |
| meta string | 元字符串 | |
| reference tracking | 引用跟踪 | |
| shared reference | 共享引用 | |
| circular reference | 循环引用 | |
| field tag ID | 字段 tag ID | Keep `tag ID` mixed for precision. |
| nullable | 可空 | |
| optional field | 可选字段 | |
| fixed-width | 定长 | |
| variable-width | 变长 | |
| little-endian | 小端序 | |
| big-endian | 大端序 | |
| offset | 偏移量 | |
| payload | 载荷 | |
| runtime | 运行时 | |
| codegen | 代码生成 | |
| cross-language | 跨语言 | |

## Terms to Avoid (Unless User Explicitly Requests)

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 线协议 | 编码格式 / 协议 | `线协议` is unnatural in this project style. |
| 传输格式 (for wire encoding semantics) | 编码格式 | Fory is not a transport framework. |
| 类定义元数据 (when referring to `type meta`) | 类型元信息 | Keep terminology short and consistent. |

## Style Notes

1. Keep product and library names in English (Apache Fory, Fory IDL, Protobuf, FlatBuffers).
2. Keep command flags and config keys in English (for example `--emit-fdl`, `enable_auto_type_id`).
3. In mixed headings, prefer repo-consistent forms (for example `Schema IDL`, `Compiler Guide` links can remain English anchor text if needed).
