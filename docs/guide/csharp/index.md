Apache Fory™ C# is a high-performance, cross-language serialization runtime for .NET. It provides object graph serialization, schema evolution, generic object payload support, and a thread-safe wrapper for concurrent workloads.

## Why Fory C#?

- High performance binary serialization for .NET 8+
- Cross-language compatibility with Fory implementations in Java, Python, C++, Go, Rust, and JavaScript
- Source-generator-based serializers for `[ForyObject]` types
- Optional reference tracking for shared and circular object graphs
- Compatible mode for schema evolution
- Thread-safe runtime (`ThreadSafeFory`) for multi-threaded services

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- .NET SDK 8.0+
- C# language version 12+

### Basic Example

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

[ForyObject]
public sealed class User
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string? Email { get; set; }
}

Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
fory.Register<User>(1);

User user = new()
{
    Id = 1,
    Name = "Alice",
    Email = "alice@example.com",
};

byte[] payload = fory.Serialize(user);
User decoded = fory.Deserialize<User>(payload);
```

## Core API Surface

- `Serialize<T>(in T value)` / `Deserialize<T>(...)`
- `Serialize<object?>(...)` / `Deserialize<object?>(...)` for dynamic payloads
- `Register<T>(uint typeId)` and namespace/name registration APIs
- `Register<T, TSerializer>(...)` for custom serializers
