Apache Fory™ C# supports cross-language serialization with other Fory runtimes.

## Enable Cross-Language Mode

C# defaults to `Xlang(true)`, but it is good practice to configure it explicitly in interoperability code.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .Xlang(true)
    .Compatible(true)
    .Build();
```

## Register with Stable IDs

```csharp
[ForyObject]
public sealed class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .Xlang(true)
    .Compatible(true)
    .Build();

fory.Register<Person>(100);
```

Use the same ID mapping on all languages.

## Register by Namespace/Type Name

```csharp
fory.Register<Person>("com.example", "Person");
```

## Cross-Language Example

### C# (Serializer)

```csharp
Person person = new() { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
byte[] payload = fory.Serialize(person);
```

### Java (Deserializer)

```java
Fory fory = Fory.builder()
    .withLanguage(Language.XLANG)
    .withRefTracking(true)
    .build();

fory.register(Person.class, 100);
Person value = (Person) fory.deserialize(payloadFromCSharp);
```

### Python (Deserializer)

```python
import pyfory

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=True, ref=True)
fory.register_type(Person, type_id=100)
value = fory.deserialize(payload_from_csharp)
```

## Type Mapping Reference

See [xlang guide](../xlang/index.md) for complete mapping.

## Best Practices

1. Keep type IDs stable and documented.
2. Enable `Compatible(true)` for rolling upgrades.
3. Register all user types on both read/write peers.
4. Validate integration with real payload round trips.
