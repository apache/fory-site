## Core Capabilities

### 🚀 High-Performance Serialization

Apache Fory™ delivers exceptional performance through advanced optimization techniques:

- **JIT Compilation**: Runtime code generation for Java eliminates virtual method calls and inlines hot paths
- **Static Code Generation**: Compile-time code generation for Rust, C++, and Go delivers peak performance without runtime overhead
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Direct memory access without intermediate buffer copies; row format enables random access and partial serialization
- **Intelligent Encoding**: Variable-length compression for integers and strings; SIMD acceleration for arrays (Java 16+)
- **Meta Sharing**: Class metadata packing reduces redundant type information across serializations

### 🌍 Cross-Language Serialization

The **[xlang serialization format](docs/specification/xlang_serialization_spec.md)** enables seamless data exchange across programming languages:

- **Automatic Type Mapping**: Intelligent conversion between language-specific types ([type mapping](docs/specification/xlang_type_mapping.md))
- **Reference Preservation**: Shared and circular references work correctly across languages
- **Polymorphism**: Objects serialize/deserialize with their actual runtime types
- **Schema Evolution**: Optional forward/backward compatibility for evolving schemas
- **Automatic Serialization**: No IDL or schema definitions required; serialize any object directly without code generation

### 📊 Row Format

A cache-friendly **[row format](docs/specification/row_format_spec.md)** optimized for analytics workloads:

- **Zero-Copy Random Access**: Read individual fields without deserializing entire objects
- **Partial Operations**: Selective field serialization and deserialization for efficiency
- **Apache Arrow Integration**: Seamless conversion to columnar format for analytics pipelines
- **Multi-Language**: Available in Java, Python, Rust and C++

### 🔒 Security & Production-Readiness

Enterprise-grade security and compatibility:

- **Class Registration**: Whitelist-based deserialization control (enabled by default)

### 🛡️ **Security & Safety**

- **Strict mode** prevents deserialization of untrusted types by type registration and checks.
- **Reference tracking** for handling circular references safely

## Rust Features

## 🚀 Why Apache Fory™ Rust?

- **🔥 Blazingly Fast**: Zero-copy deserialization and optimized binary protocols
- **🌍 Cross-Language**: Seamlessly serialize/deserialize data across Java, Python, C++, Go, JavaScript, and Rust
- **🎯 Type-Safe**: Compile-time type checking with derive macros
- **🔄 Circular References**: Automatic tracking of shared and circular references with `Rc`/`Arc` and weak pointers
- **🧬 Polymorphic**: Serialize trait objects with `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, and `Arc<dyn Trait>`
- **📦 Schema Evolution**: Compatible mode for independent schema changes
- **⚡ Two Modes**: Object graph serialization and zero-copy row-based format

### Object Graph Serialization

Automatic serialization of complex object graphs, preserving the structure and relationships between objects. The `#[derive(ForyObject)]` macro generates efficient serialization code at compile time, eliminating runtime overhead:

- Nested struct serialization with arbitrary depth
- Collection types (Vec, HashMap, HashSet, BTreeMap)
- Optional fields with `Option<T>`
- Automatic handling of primitive types and strings
- Efficient binary encoding with variable-length integers

### Shared and Circular References

Automatically tracks and preserves reference identity for shared objects using `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`. When the same object is referenced multiple times, Fory serializes it only once and uses reference IDs for subsequent occurrences. This ensures:

- **Space efficiency**: No data duplication in serialized output
- **Reference identity preservation**: Deserialized objects maintain the same sharing relationships
- **Circular reference support**: Use `RcWeak<T>` and `ArcWeak<T>` to break cycles

### Trait Object Serialization

Polymorphic serialization through trait objects, enabling dynamic dispatch and type flexibility. This is essential for plugin systems, heterogeneous collections, and extensible architectures.

**Supported trait object types:**

- `Box<dyn Trait>` - Owned trait objects
- `Rc<dyn Trait>` - Reference-counted trait objects
- `Arc<dyn Trait>` - Thread-safe reference-counted trait objects
- `Vec<Box<dyn Trait>>`, `HashMap<K, Box<dyn Trait>>` - Collections of trait objects

### Schema Evolution

Schema evolution in **Compatible mode**, allowing serialization and deserialization peers to have different type definitions. This enables independent evolution of services in distributed systems without breaking compatibility:

- Add new fields with default values
- Remove obsolete fields (skipped during deserialization)
- Change field nullability (`T` ↔ `Option<T>`)
- Reorder fields (matched by name, not position)
- Type-safe fallback to default values for missing fields

### Custom Serializers

For types that don't support `#[derive(ForyObject)]`, implement the `Serializer` trait manually. This is useful for:

- External types from other crates
- Types with special serialization requirements
- Legacy data format compatibility
- Performance-critical custom encoding

### Row-Based Serialization

High-performance **row format** for zero-copy deserialization. Unlike traditional object serialization that reconstructs entire objects in memory, row format enables **random access** to fields directly from binary data without full deserialization.

- **Zero-copy access**: Read fields without allocating or copying data
- **Partial deserialization**: Access only the fields you need
- **Memory-mapped files**: Work with data larger than RAM
- **Cache-friendly**: Sequential memory layout for better CPU cache utilization
- **Lazy evaluation**: Defer expensive operations until field access
