## Core Capabilities

### üöÄ High-Performance Serialization

Apache Fory‚Ñ¢ delivers exceptional performance through advanced optimization techniques:

- **JIT Compilation**: Runtime code generation for Java eliminates virtual method calls and inlines hot paths

- **Reference tracking** for handling circular references safely

## Rust Features

## üöÄ Why Apache Fory‚Ñ¢ Rust?

- **üî• Blazingly Fast**: Zero-copy deserialization and optimized binary protocols
- **üåç Cross-Language**: Seamlessly serialize/deserialize data across Java, Python, C++, Go, JavaScript, and Rust
- **üéØ Type-Safe**: Compile-time type checking with derive macros
- **üîÑ Circular References**: Automatic tracking of shared and circular references with `Rc`/`Arc` and weak pointers
- **üß¨ Polymorphic**: Serialize trait objects with `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, and `Arc<dyn Trait>`
- **üì¶ Schema Evolution**: Compatible mode for independent schema changes
- **‚ö° Two Modes**: Object graph serialization and zero-copy row-based format

### Object Graph Serialization

Automatic serialization of complex object graphs, preserving the structure and relationships between objects. The `#[derive(ForyObject)]` macro generates efficient serialization code at compile time, eliminating runtime overhead:

- Nested struct serialization with arbitrary depth
- Collection types (Vec, HashMap, HashSet, BTreeMap)
- Optional fields with `Option<T>`
- Automatic handling of primitive types and strings
- Efficient binary encoding with variable-length integers

### Shared and Circular References

Automatically tracks and preserves reference identity for shared objects using `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`. When the same object is referenced multiple times, Fory serializes it only once and uses reference IDs for subsequent occurrences. This ensures:

- **Space efficiency**: No data duplication in serialized output
- **Reference identity preservation**: Deserialized objects maintain the same sharing relationships
- **Circular reference support**: Use `RcWeak<T>` and `ArcWeak<T>` to break cycles

### Trait Object Serialization

Polymorphic serialization through trait objects, enabling dynamic dispatch and type flexibility. This is essential for plugin systems, heterogeneous collections, and extensible architectures.

**Supported trait object types:**

- `Box<dyn Trait>` - Owned trait objects
- `Rc<dyn Trait>` - Reference-counted trait objects
- `Arc<dyn Trait>` - Thread-safe reference-counted trait objects
- `Vec<Box<dyn Trait>>`, `HashMap<K, Box<dyn Trait>>` - Collections of trait objects

### Schema Evolution

Schema evolution in **Compatible mode**, allowing serialization and deserialization peers to have different type definitions. This enables independent evolution of services in distributed systems without breaking compatibility:

- Add new fields with default values
- Remove obsolete fields (skipped during deserialization)
- Change field nullability (`T` ‚Üî `Option<T>`)
- Reorder fields (matched by name, not position)
- Type-safe fallback to default values for missing fields

### Custom Serializers

For types that don't support `#[derive(ForyObject)]`, implement the `Serializer` trait manually. This is useful for:

- External types from other crates
- Types with special serialization requirements
- Legacy data format compatibility
- Performance-critical custom encoding

### Row-Based Serialization

High-performance **row format** for zero-copy deserialization. Unlike traditional object serialization that reconstructs entire objects in memory, row format enables **random access** to fields directly from binary data without full deserialization.

- **Zero-copy access**: Read fields without allocating or copying data
- **Partial deserialization**: Access only the fields you need
- **Memory-mapped files**: Work with data larger than RAM
- **Cache-friendly**: Sequential memory layout for better CPU cache utilization
- **Lazy evaluation**: Defer expensive operations until field access
