Please make sure subscribe to any list before attempting to post.

If you are not subscribed to the mailing list, your message will either be rejected or you won't receive the response.

### How to subscribe to a mailing list

To post messages, subscribe first by:

1. Sending an email to listname-subscribe@fory.apache.org with `listname` replaced accordingly.
2. Replying to the confirmation email you'll receive, keeping the subject line intact.
3. You'll then get a welcome email, and the subscription succeeds.

When discussing code snippets in emails, ensure:

- You do not link to files in external services, as such files can change, get deleted or the link might break and thus
  make an archived email thread useless.
- You paste text instead of screenshots of text.
- You keep formatting when pasting code in order to keep the code readable.
- There are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities.

## Slack

You can join
the [Apache Foryâ„¢ community on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fory-project/shared_invite/zt-1u8soj4qc-ieYEu7ciHOqA2mo47llS8A).

There are a couple of community rules:

- Be respectful and nice.
- All important decisions and conclusions must be reflected back to the mailing lists. "If it didn't happen on a mailing
  list, it didn't happen." - The [Apache Mottos](https://theapacheway.com/on-list/).
- Use Slack threads to keep parallel conversations from overwhelming a channel.
- Please do not direct message people for troubleshooting, issue assigning and PR review. These should be picked-up
  voluntarily.

## Issue tracker

We use GitHub Issues to track all issues:

- code related issues: https://github.com/apache/fory/issues
- website related issues: https://github.com/apache/fory-site/issues

You need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) in order to create issues.
If you don't have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), you can post an email to dev@fory.apache.org.

### Bug reports

To report a bug:

- Verify that the bug does in fact exist.
- Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/fory/issues) to verify there is no existing issue reporting the bug you've found.
- Create a [bug report](https://github.com/apache/fory/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml) on issue tracker.
- If possible, dive into the source code of fory, and submit a patch for the bug you reported, this helps ensure the bug
  will be fixed quickly.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Apache Fory is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and follows the [ASF vulnerability handling process](https://apache.org/security/#vulnerability-handling).

To report a new vulnerability you have discovered please follow the [ASF vulnerability reporting process](https://apache.org/security/#reporting-a-vulnerability), which explains how to send us details privately.

### Enhancement

Enhancements or new feature proposals are also welcome. The more concrete and rationale the proposal is, the greater the
chance it will be incorporated into future releases.
